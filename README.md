# Trends in Programming Language Popularity

Analysis of trends in popularity of programmin language across [Reddit](https://reddit.com/) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

We used data from the Reddit forum in order to better understand the popularity of Programming languages among Reddit users.Additionally, we alsp compared it to data from the Stack Overflow forum. We evaluated what programming languages are being discussed in both forums and compared how their usage or popularity has changed over time. For reaching our goal we used Visualization and Machine Learning methods based on text data and also used the quantification that we get from the upvotes and number of comments on both the platforms.

In our project :
- We extracted data from Reddit and Stackoverflow by scraping them using APIs(Reddit) and Queries(Stackoverflow) and preprocessed it for analysis.
- We performed exploratory data analyis and created meaninful visualisations to answer our research questions.
- We also used forecasting models like ARIMA and Topic Modelling for getting a future overview on the trends of the popularity of programming language.
